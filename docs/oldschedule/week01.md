# Week 1 - What is DCI?

In our first week, let's unpack what we even mean by digital culture and information. How do we define something that we are surrounded by every day? How do we talk about it? Study it? Analyze it? Critique it?

## Week 1 Assignments

**Due by Tuesday at 12pm**

### Blog post #1

What brought you to this class? How do our definitions of digital culture and information relate your personal life? Academic life? What do you find most interesting about issues around DCI? Concerning? What personal goals do you have for this class - skills you want to develop or topics you want to explore? What will success look like *for you*, beyond just an A? 

**Specifications:**

* Create a WordPress post, then turn in the URL in Canvas. 
* 300-500 words.
* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it! 

### Activity log #1 - the internet's earliest memory of you

At the beginning of this course, I asked you your earliest memory of the internet. For this activity, let's turn that question around. What is the internet's earliest memory of you? Think back to Ian Mulligan's story about Warhammer in the 1990s. 

Write a short biography of yourself using only information that can be found online about you, preferably in public with no logging in. Use Google and the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to search for youself and anything in your past life on the web. What can you find? What *can't* you find? What is surprising? What has been erased? 

After you've dug around and composed the bio, let's hear a little about the process. What was easy to find? Difficult? How has your web presence changed over time? What were you taught about using the internet with respect to privacy and how have your thoughts changed over time? How much of the content was on social media vs. another site (your school, team, etc)? If a researcher from the future is trying to learn about you, what are they missing out on? 

**Specifications:** 

* Create a WordPress page, then turn in the URL in Canvas. If you feel more comfortable keeping this page private, that's fine, just include the password when you submit.
* 50-100 word bio. 150-300 words on process. 
* Include links and images as you're comfortable. If you do not want to link to an old webpage (for privacy, embarassment, etc), consider a small screenshot.
