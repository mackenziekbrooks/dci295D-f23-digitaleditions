# Week 3 - The algorithm made me do it

*They're seemingly everywhere, influencing all your decisions. What to buy, who to date, what to watch, who to hire? Algorithm is a common enough word these days, but do we know what they are? What they do? Can we blame everything on the algorithm? What about AI or machine learning? Oh and what about ethics?* 

## Read for Tuesday: 
* [Intro to Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL8X2mlNHPM) - Crash Course
* [Cathy O'Neil Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2u_eHHzRto) - pay attention to the algorithm audit section toward the end

* OH NO I HAVE ANOTHER JURY DUTY SUMMONS
* icebreaker:
* week 2 follow up 
* What is an algorithm? - readings discussion
* Activity: let's audit an algorithm. Each team will be assigned a platform (Netflix, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube).
	1. Create a Boxnote in our [folder](https://wlu.app.box.com/folder/171015777816) for your team. 
	2. Work together to answer the following: 
		* Who created this platform? Who owns it? Are those the same thing?
		* What is the goal of this platform?
		* Where does the money come from? 
		* Where does the content come from? Are creators paid?  Do they own their creations? How do you know?
		* Give me a brief idea of the user experience. What happens on this platform? How does your experience of the platform differ from your classmates'? 
		* Where do you suspect algorithms are working? How do you know? What are they doing? Let's employ Cathy O'Neil's audit:
			* data integrity - can we trust the data being used?
			* what is this platform's definition of success?
			* accuracy - are there errors? how often? for whom does this model fail? what is the cost of failure?
			* long-term effects and feedback loops 

## Read for Thursday:
* **your turn!** What articles are catching your eye? Bring in one story about algorithms, AI, or machine learning that you encountered this week. How does this tech and its accompanying issues manifest in your culture/areas of interest? Maybe you babysit for money or for your siblings and have encountered these [weird Youtube videos](https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2). Maybe you're wondering about [algorithms and sports betting](https://theathletic.com/3554635/2022/09/01/sports-betting-and-financial-markets/)? 
* [Intro to Artificial Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0_lo_GDcFw) - Crash course
* [Crime Prediction Software Promised to be Free of Biases. New Data Shows It Perpetuates Them](https://themarkup.org/prediction-bias/2021/12/02/crime-prediction-software-promised-to-be-free-of-biases-new-data-shows-it-perpetuates-them) - The Markup (also pay attention to the format/experience of this piece!)
* [Anatomy of AI](https://anatomyof.ai/) - not required, but check out as an example of a digital essay 

## Thursday, September 29, 2022

* your article!
* project chat 

## Week 3 Assignments - Due Tuesday at 12pm

### Blog post #3 
Let’s start brainstorming about potential project topics. What are you interested in? What’s compelling about your major/minor? How do DCI concepts fit into that topic? If you don't have a major/minor yet, could this be a way to explore a topic related to a potential area of interest? Maybe you want to dive into something you haven't had a chance to explore in college yet. Think broadly! 

Next, what questions do you have about that topic? Take a look at the [final project description](../../assignments/#digital-essay) to get a sense of what you'll be doing with the digital essay. 

**Specs:** 
	
* Create a WordPress post, turn in the link on Canvas.
* 300-500 words.
* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it! 

### Activity log #3  - AI for good?

We've read a lot about the dangers of algorithms and AI and how they "automate the status quo" (Davidson). But what about AI for good? I don't want you to leave this class being entirely pessimisstic about technology. How can these technologies improve the world? For this activity, I want you to invent an app or website that will do its best to be free of bias or harm. What sector would you create this app in? How would you ensure it passes the algorithm audit? Your chosen topic can be in response to the article you found for Thursday, or it can be something new.

**Specs:** 

* Create a WordPress post, turn in the link on Canvas.
* 300-500 words. Can use bullet points, headings, etc. 
* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
* Include at least one image - either a sketch, stock photo, etc that illustrates your app. 
* Address Cathy O'Neil's algorithm audit. How will you guarantee your app passes the test? What's your evidence? 
	* data integrity - can we trust the data being used?
	* what is this platform's definition of success?
	* accuracy - are there errors? how often? for whom does this mdoel fail?
	* long-term effects and feedback loops
