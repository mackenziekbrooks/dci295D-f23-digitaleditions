* Create a post on WordPress, turn it in on Canvas.
* 200-300 words.


## Your final reflection is due 12/16 by 5pm. 

No project is complete without time taken to reflect on its successes and lessons learned. Talk about your feelings! What have you learned about digital culture and information? What have you learned about yourself and the way you learn new things? 

**Specs:**

* Due Friday, December 16th by 5pm.
* Submit as a document in Canvas.
* 500-1000 words.
* Address the following. Your answers should be about the course as a whole, not just your project topic.
	* What have you learned? Which of these things is most important to you? What did you learn about the material that you didn't expect? What did you learn about yourself?
    * What has been challenging? Why?
   	* Think back to the start of class and blog post #1. How has your relationship with technology changed? What about your conception of digital culture and information? Have you met your own goals for this course?
    * Revisit the [objectives](https://mackenziekbrooks.github.io/dci101-f22/#course-objectives) for this course. Did we address those objectives?
    * If you could do it all again, what would you do differently?
    * How can you apply the things you learned in this course to future courses or non-academic endeavors?
