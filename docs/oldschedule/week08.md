# Week 8 - Method 2: Web scraping and more ethics 

*How do we capture the web so we can use it later? What will scholars be able to study in fifty -or even five– years? This week we’ll discuss efforts to preserve the Web and learn techniques for capturing content and turning it into data.*

## Tuesday, November 1, 2022
* Reminder: Draft project proposal due!!!; Lilly Mitchell '21 visit announcement
* icebreaker: 
* ethics of web scraping
* Activity 8.1 - Believing & Doubting Game (by Peter Elbow)
	* On your own, refresh yourself on the readings for this week, particularly the Fair Game article. 
	* At your table, spend 5-7 minutes laying out all the reasons why web scraping is ethical. No counter arguments! Fully inhabit the idea of believing this viewpoint.
	* Once that's done, we'll switch. Take the opposite perspective. Setting aside your own viewpoint, what are all the reasons that web scraping is unethical? 
* Activity 8.2 - Robots.txt
	* First, let's learn how to prevent our websites from being crawled (though not necessarily scraped). 
	* Login to your Control Panel at `http://www.yourdomain.info/cpanel`
	* Navigate to File Manager. Double click to enter `public_html`
	* Click `+ File` to create a new file. Call it `robots.txt`. Lower case is necessary.
	* Visit this [site](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt) to learn about what you could place in this file. You don't have to add anything! Just know you can. 
	* Visit `http://www.anywebsite.com/robots.txt` to see what others setup. 
* Activity 8.3 - [The Web scraping trick I want everyone to know](https://www.octoparse.com/blog/simple-web-scraping-using-google-sheets)
* Activity 8.4 - Web scraping tools
	* There are a lot of tools out there for web scraping, depending on your needs!
		* [Webscraper.io](https://webscraper.io)
		* [Webrecorder.net](https://webrecorder.net/tools)
		* [Pyktok](https://github.com/dfreelon/pyktok)
		* [Documenting the Now](http://www.docnow.io/docnow-app/)
	* At your table, answer the following questions in a Boxnote (here's the [folder](https://wlu.app.box.com/folder/180134412494)) about your assigned tool:
		* Who made this? 
		* Is it free? Open source? 
		* What can you do with this tool?
		* How does it work? Is it an app on your computer, a browser plug-in, a code library, etc? 
		* What kind of data does it generate? 
		* What would be useful about this tool? What might make it hard to use?

## Week 8 Assignments

**Due Tuesday at 12pm**

### Blog post #8 

Revision is important! In this post, you'll summarize the discussion in our individual meeting. How did your thinking change? What are you going to modify about your project? What further steps do you need to take? What are your very specific next steps?  

**Specs:** 
* Create a WordPress post, turn in the link on Canvas.
* 150-300 words. 
* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it! 

### Activity log #8

Let's pratice some web scraping for your project. Identify 1-3 websites that may contain data embedded within the HTML. While it doesn't have to be related to your topic, this is a good chance to get a head start on your project! Using the notes and research on web scraping tools, select the most appropriate tool for the data on your website. It may take multiple attempts, multiple websites, or multiple data sources to get this to work! We're at a point in the course now where I'm going to expect a little more of your troubleshooting abilities (though you're free to email me with questions or come to office hours!). In your write-up, address the following:

* What worked? What was easy to figure out? 
* What didn't work? What was difficult?
* When did you run up against the limits of your tools? 
* What about ethics? Given our discussion on Tuesday, how comfortable do you feel about capturing this data? How will you credit the creator? 

**Specs:** 

* Create a WordPress post, turn in the link on Canvas.
* 200-400 words on your process.
* Upload the file or link out to a Google spreadsheet with the data you harvested.
* Be sure to share the URL of the website you chose to scrape!! 
* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it!
