## Accommodations

I am committed to ensuring access to course content for all students. Reasonable accommodations are available for students with disabilities. Contact Lauren Kozak, Title IX Coordinator and Director of Disability Resources, to confidentially discuss your needs and the accommodation process. More information can be found at: https://www.wlu.edu/disability-accommodations/undergraduate-accommodations

If you have already been approved for accommodations, please meet with me within the first two weeks of the term so we can develop an implementation plan together. It is important to meet as early in the term as possible; this will ensure that your accommodations are implemented early on. If you have accommodations for test-taking, please remember that arrangements must be made at least a week before the date of the test or exam.

## Attendance

You may notice that I do not factor in attendance and participation into your grade. This is on purpose. I design my classes so that you can't *not* participate. Class sessions are structured to help you advance your learning, not just for you to receive content. If you miss a lot of class, it will affect your grade because you aren't learning what you need to learn to fulfill assignments, not because I've docked a point. But life happens and sometimes you need a day or two. Or a pandemic happens and we all need a break. I expect that you'll talk to me about these instances and take responsibility for catching up on what you've missed. 

## Plagiarism

All writing should be your own or should be cited properly. The writing assignments in this course are different than what is required in other courses, so we will discuss proper citation procedures for writing for the Web, writing in a group, and writing technical documentation.
