## Specifications Grading
The assignment and grading structure for this course might be a little different than what you're used to. In this course, we'll use something called *Specifications Grading*. The goals of the system are to reduce the stress and mystery of grades while also raising academic standards. I chose this system to complement the technologies and digital methods we will be learning this term, as well as to combat grade anxiety. It is more important to me that you explore and experiment with these methods than it is that you get the "right answer." It's hard to feel comfortable experimenting and making mistakes if you're worried about every little point. 

So rather than assign points or grades, I will mark each assignment as Complete/Incomplete according to a set of specifications. 

You must complete a certain number of assignments in each category to receive the corresponding grade, as seen in the table below. This means that your grade is always going up as you complete more assignments. It also means that you must complete the requisite number of assignments in each category to get the grade. 

You will use Canvas to turn in assignments and to receive feedback. I will mark your assignments as complete/incomplete, however! Canvas will not be able to calculate your current grade with this system.  	

This is a lot to get used to at first, so please ask any questions you have early in the semester. We will do a midterm check-in so you have a good understanding of where you are. 



### Tokens

You're not expected to be perfect at every assignment! To help you recover from any incomplete assignments, you will be assigned **three tokens**. Using a token will give you one week to revise and resubmit an assignment to receive credit. To use a token, you will submit an entry in Canvas declaring which assignment you're revising. I'll award a point in Canvas for each token you use, but these points are not factored into your final grade. Using a token does not guarantee that you will receive a complete on the resubmission, but hopefully with my feedback you can get there. 

Examples:

* You have a big test in another class due on the same day as an assignment. To give yourself an extension on the DCI assignment, you submit a token before the due date of the DCI assignment you're planning to miss.
* You receive an incomplete on an assignment. After reading my feedback or discussing in class, you decide to revise the assignment. You submit a token and declare which assignment you're revising.

## Attendance

You may notice that I do not factor in attendance and participation into your regular grade. This is on purpose. I design my classes so that you can't *not* participate. Class sessions are structured to help you advance your learning, not just for you to receive content. If you miss a lot of class, it will affect your grade because you aren't learning what you need to learn to fulfill assignments. But life happens and sometimes you need a day or two. Or a pandemic happens and we all need a break. I expect that you'll talk to me about these instances and take responsibility for catching up on what you've missed. 

That being said, more than two unexcused/unexplained absences will start to affect your final grade. Unexcused/unexplained means you did not contact me before class starts. Each of these absences will lower your final grade by 1/3 (so B+ to B, or B to B-).
