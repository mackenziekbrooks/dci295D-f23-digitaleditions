### Tuesday, September 12
* icebreaker:
* what is digital scholarship? what is text? what are digital editions? 

??? abstract "reading/thinking/writing response: life of a text" 
	
	How did our discussion make you think differently about books, text, and the Internet? For this response, think about a text that you have spent time with before. It could be a novel you studied in high school, a picture book you read over and over, a poem you had to memorize, a pamphlet that lives in a drawer, a letter from a friend or family member, or even the instructions to your favorite game. It really could be anything, there's no right answer here, but we will continue to engage with this text and you will be asked to share, so keep that in mind in making your selection.

	Describe it. What is this text? What container is it in? Is that container unique or one of many copies? Who wrote it? Is there a single, identified author or not? Is it published? How can you access the text? Can you buy it or check it out of the library? Print or digital or both? How did this text come to be? What other forms might exist? In 50 years, will someone be able to read this text? How? Could it be studied by a scholar? Include a picture if you have.

	Specs:

	* Due Thursday by noon.
	* 300-400 words
	* Submit on Canvas.
	* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
	* Your post should address the prompt thoroughly. Responses that only engage with a portion of the questions may not pass. 
	* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it! 

??? warning "read for 9/14"
	
	We'll be working our way through this resource if you want to look ahead:
	
	* [HTML & CSS](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/)

### Thursday, September 14
* icebreaker:
* HTML + CSS 

??? question "coding activity #1" 

	Let's keep practicing your HTML. For the next few weeks, we're going to build a small website about the text you wrote about for Thursday. Since HTML is a document markup language, you'll be marking up your text (or a portion of it) in a similar way. If your text has a heading, you should use the `<h1>` tag. If your text is a recipe, then a `<ol>` or `<ul>` may be appropriate. Your document should also include the tags listed below, so you may need to add a summary to your text or links to other websites. 

	Specs:

	* Due Tuesday by noon.
	* Upload your HTML file(s) to Canvas.
	* Your HTML should be well-formed. Tags should open and close and nest appropriately.  
	* Include the following tags: 
		* all the structure tags like `<html>` `<head>` `<body>` `<p>`
		* one or more level of headings (so `<h1>`)
		* one or more links
		* one image (use an image on the web, not on your own computer)
		* bold or italics
		* a blockquote, a table, and a list (ordered or unordered)
	* Do not include any CSS or styles (colors, fonts, spacing) at this time. That's for next week!
