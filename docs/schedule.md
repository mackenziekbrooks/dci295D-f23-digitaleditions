??? abstract "reading/thinking/writing response: life of a text" 
	
	How did our discussion make you think differently about books, text, and the Internet? For this response, think about a text that you have spent time with before. It could be a novel you studied in high school, a picture book you read over and over, a poem you had to memorize, a pamphlet that lives in a drawer, a letter from a friend or family member, or even the instructions to your favorite game. It really could be anything, there's no right answer here, but we will continue to engage with this text and you will be asked to share, so keep that in mind in making your selection.

	Describe it. What is this text? What container is it in? Is that container unique or one of many copies? Who wrote it? Is there a single, identified author or not? Is it published? How can you access the text? Can you buy it or check it out of the library? Print or digital or both? How did this text come to be? What other forms might exist? In 50 years, will someone be able to read this text? How? Could it be studied by a scholar? Which of our definitions of text seems to apply here? Include a picture if you have.

	Specs:

	* Due Thursday by noon.
	* 300-400 words
	* Submit on Canvas.
	* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
	* Your post should address the prompt thoroughly. Responses that only engage with a portion of the questions may not pass. 
	* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it! 

??? warning "read for 9/14"

	These two pieces are designed to get you in the right mindset for learning to code:

### Thursday, September 14
* [icebreaker generator](https://mackenziekbrooks.github.io/icebreaker-generator/)
* crazy wall activity synthesis:
	* what did you learn about your topic?
	* what did you learn about the research process?
	* what was easy? what was hard? 
* HTML + CSS 

??? question "coding activity #1" 

	Let's keep practicing your HTML. For the next few weeks, we're going to build a small website about the text you wrote about for Tuesday. Since HTML is a document markup language, you'll be marking up your text (or a portion of it) in a similar way. If your text has a heading, you should use the `<h1>` tag. If your text is a recipe, then a `<ol>` or `<ul>` may be appropriate. Your document should also include the tags listed below, so you may need to add a summary to your text or links to other websites. 

	Specs:

	* Due Tuesday by noon.
	* Upload your HTML file(s) to Canvas.
	* Your HTML should be well-formed. Tags should open and close and nest appropriately. Tags should be appropriate to the content they're surrounding.  
	* Include the following tags: 
		* all the structure tags like `<html>` `<head>` `<body>` `<p>`
		* one or more level of headings (so `<h1>`)
		* one or more links
		* one or more images (use an image on the web, not on your own computer). Include the alt attribute for alternative text.
		* bold or italic text
		* an empty element like a break or horizontal rule
		* a blockquote, a table, and a list (ordered or unordered)
		* one or more `<div>` tags
	* You can use CSS, but it's not required.


## Week 2 - How can we read? 

??? warning "read for 9/19"

* [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iGWrVd5_F_e6RBPeXjn_PMED4zjZUDsMXydWBmq3k2s/edit?usp=sharing)

??? abstract "reading/thinking/writing response" 
	
	Time to conduct some document analysis on your own. You'll pick a book in class and take it home with you to complete this assignment. If you can't figure out the answer to a question, don't leave it blank! Write about how you *tried* to figure out the answer. Use this [digital version of the form](assets/DCI295D-F23-Week2-reading.docx) we used in class.

	Specs:

	* Due Thursday by noon.
	* No word count, but every box should be filled in. If the section doesn't apply or you couldn't find any evidence, talk to me about how you determined that. 
	* Add 3-5 photos to the document to highlight the most interesting parts of this book. Reference them in the document. 
	* There is no detail too small! Even if you don't know why it matters, this is an exercise in slow looking.
	* Submit on Canvas.

 
??? warning "read for 9/21"

	We're going to continue working through [HTML and CSS Are Hard](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/), concentrating on the "Box Model," "CSS Selectors," and "Flex box." 

	As a reminder, you're welcome to watch Youtube or LinkedIn Learning when to augment your learning. 

### Thursday, September 21
* icebreaker:
* CSS Pt 2 

??? question "coding activity #2" 

	Let's add more CSS to our sites. We're going to build on what we learned on Thursday about the Box model (content, padding, border, margins) as well as classes and ids. I want to see that you're trying out these new elements and styles and can create a coherent and nice looking page. I'm not going to specify exactly how all these pieces should come together. You may want to add more content to your page to make it work, perhaps a header image or a footer. This exercise might involve more trial and error. Don't forget you can use browser tools to help.

	Specs:

	* Due Tuesday by noon.
	* Turn in two files on Canvas, one called `index.html` and one called `style.css`.
	* Include the following:
		* 3-5 `<div>` tags to contain your content. 
		* Each `<div>` should have a class to dictate style.
		* Use a class on at least two other elements, perhaps headings, paragraphs, or links.
		* Use at least 2 `<id>`s to style specific elements.
		* Set the margins, padding, and border for your `<div>` tags. 
		* Add pseudo-classes for links.
		* You **can** use floats if it's helpful for your page layout, but not required. 

## Week 3 - How do books work?

??? warning "read for 9/26"

	* [History of the Book Chapter 5](https://hob.gseis.ucla.edu/HoBCoursebook_Ch_5.html)

### Tuesday, September 26
* icebreaker
* printing day!! We'll meet in my office/printing studio (Leyburn 218). Don't wear nice clothes, things might get a little messy. Think about a line of text you might want to print on a poster or card.

??? abstract "reading/thinking/writing response" 
	
	The impact of printing, especially moveable type, on civilization is immense. Printing made texts more accessible and put information into the hands of more people - think about the changes to religions or science during this period. But we have our own version of this revolution! The internet! In this response, I want you to compare and contrast these major information revolutions. You've been a consumer of the internet and of books, but now you're learning how they're put together. What similarities do you see? Differences? Hone in on one idea or concept from our readings about the history of printing, then find a similar phenomenon today. For example: the "History of the Book" text discusses the change to labor practices in printing. I might compare that to the world of content moderation - contract workers who are paid a low wage to review (often horrifying) content to keep out of social media feeds. You might also compare/contrast the act of printing with type to crafting your own HTML document. There's no right answer here - I want to know what you found interesting and the connections that are sparking in your mind. The Whitney Trettien video is another great example of connecting the past to the present, not necessarily seeing them as a simple progression or as concepts that should be view in opposition to each other (print vs. digital).

	Specs:

	* Due Thursday by noon.
	* 300-400 words
	* Find an idea or concept from our reading (or video) to incorporate into your post. Include a quote and cite your source (doesn't count against your word count).
	* Connect a historical concept to a modern one. 
	* Submit on Canvas.


??? warning "read for 9/28"

	* Start reading through [Command Line Crash Course](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/appendixa.html).
	* Familiarize yourself with [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world). 

### Thursday, September 28
* icebreaker
* what did we think of printing?
* Command line + GitHub


??? question "coding activity #3" 

	Your task is to follow the tutorial in the [Programming Historian - Bash Command Line](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash) tutorial then use git and GitHub to post the results online. 

	First, complete the tutorial. Before you close out, you should save your command line history with the command `history > history.txt` which will put your commands into a text file. 

	Second, create a new basic website. Just practice, but you should be able to create the basic structure more quickly now. Your website could contain a heading, some text, and a link to a your `history.txt` file contained in the same folder. 

	Third, use git to create a new repository on your computer containing your website and text file. Set up that repository on GitHub. Push the files to GitHub, then publish with GitHub page.

	Specs:

	* Due Tuesday by noon. 
	* Turn in the link to the GitHub pages site. 
	* You must include your command line history in a text file.
	* Your site must be pushed to GitHub using the command line.
	* Your site should be deployed with GitHub Pages.

## Week 4 - What is a digital edition?

??? question "coding activity #4" 

	Let's practice with Bootstrap some more. Build on the new site you created in class. The topic can be of your choosing! But you need to incorporate the following:

	* Grid system - Some of your content should be in multiple columns. 
	* Table - Jazz up a table with some "accented features."

	* Turn in the GitHub pages link on Canvas.
	* While you can add your own CSS in a style.css file, try to incorporate Bootstrap's built-in styling options through the use of class names.
	* While we're taking a grab bag approach, your page should still make sense and your code should be well-formed. 


## Week 5 - RHS + break!

??? warning "read for 10/10"

	Let's prep for our guest speaker: Eric Wilson, the Director of the Rockbridge Historical Society. 

	* Spend some time on the [RHS website](https://rockbridgehistory.org/). What are the most recent programs? Who and what do they concern? What are the major activities of this organization? 

	* Watch this [History of Rockbridge County](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmOHSyLCd5U) video. 

	* Take a little walk (or drive if you have a car) through campus, Lexington, or the county. What do you observe? What evidence of the past remains? What do you wonder about? 

	* Remember, we're going to be working with the [RHS Proceedings](https://wlu.app.box.com/folder/223091696832). Start looking through these volumes and getting a sense of topics. We also have an [index available](https://wlu.app.box.com/file/1289009716733) that lists all the individual articles. You'll need to settle on a topic for the [proposal](https://mackenziekbrooks.github.io/dci295D-f23-digitaleditions/assignments/#proposal) on 10/19 so it's time to get thinking.

	* Finally, think of some questions for Eric. Your questions could be about the local community, its history, or the work of the organization. 


### Tuesday, October 10

??? abstract "reading/thinking/writing response #6" 

	In order for us to create a site for our digital editions that works for everyone, we need to get on the same page about our encoding decisions! The first step is for you to identify the potential decisions and items that will need to be marked up in your article. Response #6 is designed to get you documenting those items so we can come up with shared practices. 

	Look ahead to the [TEI body markup assignment](assignments.md/#tei-body-markup) to see what type of tags you should be including. 

	Specs:

	* Due Thursday, November 9th at noon. We'll start in class on Tuesday.
