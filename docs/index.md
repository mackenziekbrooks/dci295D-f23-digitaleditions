Office hours: Mondays 10a-12pm, Thursdays 2-3pm, or by appointment. Please don't hesitate to schedule a meeting with me! I have a lot of meetings in my work life and can't always honor office hours. I'm usually on campus five days a week and happy to meet outside of office hours (but still between 9am-5pm.) 

## Course description
Can we trust text? What happens on the journey from handwritten manuscript to your phone screen? Does the meaning change when the format changes? How do the hands of editors, publishers, printers alter a work? When we can search millions of books in an instant, how do we find nuance in the materiality of text? This course explores the definitions, purposes, and uses of scholarly editions of literary and historic texts in the digital age. Using material from Leyburn Library's Special Collections and Archives, we will work together to build our own digital edition. Along the way, students will learn foundational tech skills for digital publishing. 

## Course objectives

Students will:

* Comprehend the definition, purpose, value, and uses of scholarly editions.
* Acquire foundational skills in digital publishing, including HTML, CSS, TEI, static site generation, and GitHub.
* Work collaboratively to build our own digital edition website.
* Develop skills in research with archival/primary and secondary sources.


## DCI Learning Outcomes
