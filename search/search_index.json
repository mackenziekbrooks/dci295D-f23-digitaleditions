What happens on the journey from handwritten manuscript to your phone screen? Does the meaning change when the format changes? How do the hands of editors, publishers, printers alter a work? When we can search millions of books in an instant, how do we find nuance in the materiality of text? This course explores the definitions, purposes, and uses of scholarly editions of literary and historic texts in the digital age. Using material from Leyburn Library's Special Collections and Archives, we will work together to build our own digital edition. Along the way, students will learn foundational tech skills for digital publishing. Course objectives # Students will: Comprehend the definition, purpose, value, and uses of scholarly editions. Acquire foundational skills in digital publishing, including HTML, CSS, TEI, static site generation, and GitHub. Work collaboratively to build our own digital edition website. Develop skills in research with archival/primary and secondary sources. DCI Learning Outcomes # Develop critical capacities for analyzing the role of technology and digital media in contemporary culture, and apply those capacities to a range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary inquiries. Develop the technical skills necessary for academic and professional success, with an emphasis on online communication and information. Demonstrate the ability to communicate across different media and to both academic and general audiences. Engage in collaborative, interdisciplinary, project-based learning.

Prompts will invite you to dig deeper into readings, discussion topics, or your own experiences. These posts aren't meant to be busy work, rather they're a chance for you to practice thinking critically and analyzing information. They help me know what you're thinking and how you're thinking. Plus, I know that talking a lot in class isn't for everyone. Think of these posts as an extension of your participation. You don't have to know all the answers, just be thoughtful in your questions! General specifications: Turn in your post on Canvas. Due Thursdays by noon (12pm). Posts will be in response to the readings and discussion we have on Tuesdays. 300-500 words. Free from grammatical errors, typos. Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it! Coding Activity Log # Each week (usually Thursday) we\u2019ll learn a new technology or coding skill together in class. The activity log will document the ways you practice and build that skill on your own. Logs will be submitted in Canvas and later on GitHub. These skills will help you complete the final project, but they'll also serve you well in future encounters with the internet and can go on your resume. Specifications: Turn in on Canvas. Some assignments might be uploaded to GitHub, so check the individual assignment. Activities might include writing code AND some writing about your process. Think: show your work in math. Digital Edition Project # Our big project for this course is the creation of a website for publishing digital editions of documents held by Leyburn Library's Special Collections and Archives. This is exciting! You are helping make these documents available to the wider world when they otherwise would stay inaccessible or hard to find. Not only that, part of your job is to add valuable scholarly commentary to the texts so they are updated with the latest research and understanding. Specifically, we'll be encoding articles from the Proceedings of the Rockbridge Historical Society. Each student will select one article after an exploration and proposal process. You'll be responsible for encoding that article in TEI XML. You will research the subject of the article and write annotations that add context and images or point to updated research or other resources in Special Collections and Archives. To accomplish this, we'll break the project down into a number of parts. Each of these components will count in the Digital Edition Project category for our Specs Grading System . Proposal # Time to figure out which article you'd like to work on for your project. There are many topics to choose from! You should select something that is of interest to you - maybe it's the location, the people involved, or the content it's covering. Shorter articles will not necessarily be easier. You should browse the Proceedings in print and use the Table of Contents spreadsheet (data entry by Margaret Alexander) or the index. Be sure to completely read your article before you make your selection. Specs: Due October 19th at noon. Turn in on Canvas. 400-500 words. Free from grammatical errors, typos. Include links/citations as necessary. Address the following: Why this article? What struck you? What was your process of elimination like? What is going to be interesting/challenging/unique about this article? Using our document analysis skills, what do you notice? What features will need to be marked up? Do some cursory Googling or library research. Can you find more about the place/people/events described? Are there related articles in the Proceedings already? Include a list of 5 or more sources that will be your initial starting place when conducting research. Provide some initial comments on potential comments/annotations. What's confusing to you? What needs more explanation? Is there language that needs to be updated? Annotated Bibliography # This project is going to require some deep research. Heads-up! Some of your sources may not be available on the internet, but only in Special Collections or in the stacks. This assignment is designed to get you digging for sources and reflecting on their use in your project. Rely on our research workshop day for places to conduct this research. Specs: Due October 31 at noon. Turn in on Canvas. Include 8-10 sources. 4+ must be primary sources and 4+ should be secondary sources . Each source should be formatted in an established citation style (probably Chicago?). Use Zotero if it helps! Under each source should be a 2 sentence annotation. In the first sentence, summarize the source. In the second sentence, say something about why this source is useful for your project. teiHeader Markup # An essential piece of your project is completing the <teiHeader part of your digital edition. This section of the XML contains all the metadata (my favorite!) about your article - including information about you, the encoder! You'll also want to follow our project guidelines so that there is some consistency across articles and everything displays correctly. Specs: Due November 7 at noon. Upload to GitHub, turn in link on Canvas. You must fill out the following fields according to our project guidelines: teiHeader teiHeader TEI Body Markup # This is the core part of your digital edition! Time to markup the body of the text. This section of the XML contains all the actual text from your article as it appears on the page. While you can copy the text from the .pdf or .txt files, you should be diligent about checking for OCR errors. Your markup should include the tags/elements in our guidelines, as well as any others are that are relevant. Specs: Due November 14 at noon. Upload to GitHub, turn in link on Canvas. You must fill out the following fields according to our project guidelines: teiHeader teiHeader Annotations # The annotations of your digital edition is what sets it apart as a scholarly project. They are the point where you, the scholar and encoder, can chime with your own observations, updates, expertise, links, etc. They create the hypertext potential of the internet - a kicking off point for research rabbit holes. You should plan to craft 8-10 quality annotations that expand on aspects of your chosen article. Specs: Draft of 6 annotations due November 30 at noon. Final annotations due December 7 at noon. Upload to GitHub, turn in link on Canvas. 8-10 annotations. Annotations can and should vary in length. At least two should be multiple sentences in length. Annotations can and should vary in content. They could link out to other sources or media. Reflection # No project is complete without time taken to reflect on its successes and lessons learned. Talk about your feelings! What have you learned about digital editions and DCI more broadly? What have you learned about yourself and the way you learn new things? Specs: Due December 15 at noon. Submit as a document in Canvas. 500-1000 words. Address the following. Your answers should be about the course as a whole, not just your digital edition. What have you learned? Which of these things is most important to you? What did you learn about the material that you didn't expect? What did you learn about yourself? How can you apply the tech and research skills you learned in this course to future courses or non-academic endeavors? What has been challenging? Why? Revisit the objectives for this course.

Whether it's for work, school, volunteering, organizing, art, or just for fun, there are plenty of ways to carve out your own corner of the Web. Social media platforms like LinkedIn or Facebook are ubiquitous now, but it used to be that if you wanted to appear in search results, you had to create your own website. If you are a student or navigating the professional world, chances are that 1) someone out there might Google you and 2) you want them to see accurate information and work that you're proud of. A professional website can be a simple single page with limited information, or it can contain your whole life. Chances are, at some point you've relied on information from a personal website. Maybe you found an article you need for a bibliography, a snippet of code that had been giving you trouble, or even an email address for someone who has lost their wallet. If you're conducting research in a field, making art, or selling products, there are others who will be interested in the work you're doing. Check out the sites of others in your intended field of study or career path to see what their websites look like. Some scholars share articles they've written, code libraries, data they've gathered, or new methods they're experimenting with. In the library and digital scholarship world, open and public scholarship is highly valued. Many of the links in this website go to the websites of DH-ers who have been generous enough to share a tutorial or write up their thoughts on a particular method. Whether you create a professional portfolio or not, there is a lot to be said for the form of a website. Most of the scholarship we read, not to mention everything else, has been designed and formatted to be consumed on the Web. Presenting your own work in that format gives you experience with seemingly silly things like getting your images to float nicely with your text or finding a place to reliably store your data. Creating a clean, well-organized website is harder than it looks! Just like it's easier to read a paragraph than to write one, creating a website takes practice.

If you're a student, you may not want your homework following you for decades to come. You have the right to privacy and to completing your coursework in a secure way. While you are required to use your domain for this class, you can make it private during the course or remove it after the class is over. The domain provided for you in this class will be de-activated following your graduation, unless you choose to take over ownership.

WordPress # Whether you knew it or not, chances are you have visited many, many WordPress websites. WordPress is an open-source content management system used by 42% of the web (as claimed by WordPress). Though it's thought of as a blogging platform, it powers plenty of major websites. We'll use WordPress in this class as a platform for blog posts and your final project. It is easy to install on your domain and has plenty of customization options. It's likely that you might need to use WordPress at a future job, internship, or volunteer venture, so it's a good skill to have.

In this course, we'll use something called Specifications Grading . The goals of the system are to reduce the stress and mystery of grades while also raising academic standards. I chose this system to complement the technologies and digital methods we will be learning this term, as well as to combat grade anxiety. It is more important to me that you explore and experiment with these methods than it is that you get the \"right answer.\" It's hard to feel comfortable experimenting and making mistakes if you're worried about every little point. So rather than assign points or grades, I will mark each assignment as Complete/Incomplete according to a set of specifications. You must complete a certain number of assignments in each category to receive the corresponding grade, as seen in the table below. This means that your grade is always going up as you complete more assignments. It also means that you must complete the requisite number of assignments in each category to get the grade. You will use Canvas to turn in assignments and to receive feedback. I will mark your assignments as complete/incomplete, however! Canvas will not be able to calculate your current grade with this system. This is a lot to get used to at first, so please ask any questions you have early in the semester. We will do a midterm check-in so you have a good understanding of where you are. Tokens # You're not expected to be perfect at every assignment! To help you recover from any incomplete assignments, you will be assigned three tokens . Using a token will give you one week to revise and resubmit an assignment to receive credit. To use a token, you will submit an entry in Canvas declaring which assignment you're revising. I'll award a point in Canvas for each token you use, but these points are not factored into your final grade.

In this course, we'll use something called Specifications Grading . The goals of the system are to reduce the stress and mystery of grades while also raising academic standards. I chose this system to complement the technologies and digital methods we will be learning this term, as well as to combat grade anxiety. It is more important to me that you explore and experiment with these methods than it is that you get the \"right answer.\" It's hard to feel comfortable experimenting and making mistakes if you're worried about every little point. So rather than assign points or grades, I will mark each assignment as Complete/Incomplete according to a set of specifications. You must complete a certain number of assignments in each category to receive the corresponding grade, as seen in the table below. This means that your grade is always going up as you complete more assignments. It also means that you must complete the requisite number of assignments in each category to get the grade. You will use Canvas to turn in assignments and to receive feedback. I will mark your assignments as complete/incomplete, however! Canvas will not be able to calculate your current grade with this system. This is a lot to get used to at first, so please ask any questions you have early in the semester.

Picking a topic Research! What's my project? Research Questions and Data Modeling Creating data Finding data Analyzing your data Case study: Spanish Gallery Resources Picking a topic # First things first, what do you even want to do? Big question, right? Don't worry, it's normal to feel lost at the start. You're probably at the beginning of your academic career and haven't gone through the years of training like most scholars have. You might not feel committed to one discipline or subject area yet. If that's the case, this is your chance to experiment! You can try on a topic like you try on a pair of shoes, spending a little time in them to see if they're still comfortable after walking a mile to the grocery store. For most of you, this is one assignment for one class, not something that has to follow you the rest of your life, unless you want it to. Embrace the ability to travel in your own direction. Some of you may be \"idea people\" and feel like you're brimming with potential topics already. If so, that's great! There will be a section about \"scope\" for you later on. If you need some help generating ideas, it can be helpful to consider these categories: Objects - What thing do you want to learn more about? Is there a book, a moment in history, or an archival collection that has caught your interest? Are you interested in fanfiction about anime, 19th century detective novels, the 1918 pandemic, or perhaps some beautiful illustrated maps you saw in a museum exhibit? Some people are drawn to objects and collections, and work from there. There are lots of ways to source or generate data about objects. You might want to spend your time crafting a beautiful, if small, data set about a set of objects. Questions - What questions keep you up at night? What do you ponder while you run or while you're driving? What have you wondered about while reading for your philosophy class? You might be more of an abstract thinker. How can you approach these questions in a data-driven way? You might be more interested in big approaches to data - what can learn from hundreds or thousands of texts? What patterns can you find through time and space? You should consider working with existing data sets and playing with the kinds of questions and answers you can find. Skills - What do you want to get better at? Some folks are more motivated by improving their own abilities, rather than doing a deep dive into a topic. That's okay too. What skills do you want to work on? How might they transfer to another project or method? Do you want to get really good at data visualization, or maybe play with a new programming language? Or perhaps build confidence with web scraping? Go for it! You can let the software drive your decision making. We need the builders, just as much as we need the analyzers. Research! # Once you have an inkling of what your topic might be, it's time to get researching. You want to get a sense of what is out there already about this topic. You want to find resources that might help with the context, but you also want to see what kind of work has already been done. Save yourself the frustration of getting halfway through a data collection project before you realize that someone has already done this work before. Getting a sense of existing approaches might also help steer you toward your approach. What do similar projects lack? How can you fill in the gaps? Some of you may already be flying through the internet, opening up tab after tab, making notes. But you might also find this part of the process to be paralyzing. It's a wide open world out there. Here are some tips to help you structure this important piece: Structure your research process into phases. Gathering, analyzing, refining, etc. Give yourself time to explore, without deciding whether or not an article, a tutorial, a website is useful or not. You're just trying familiarize yourself with what is out there. You can use a document or something like ZOtero to help. Once you've done your gathering, then spend some time actually reading and considering what you've found. It is useful? Does it help you think about your topic in a new way? Did the title seem great but the content was lacking? Does an article give you a new path to explore? Try to sit with what you've found and think about it before moving on. Once you have a solid sense of what is out there about your topic, it's time to refine and narrow your scope. This stage has its own challenges. It can be hard to make a decision at this stage. You feel pressure to make the right one. Don't worry, you can still pivot if you need to, but remember that there are benefits to making decisions and moving ahead now. You're probably on a deadline and need to get moving onto the next phase of the project. Consider creating a mental or physical \"parking lot\" for ideas or resources that you are intrigued by, but don't have time for right now. You may notice that these tips are conflating the idea of your topic and the research about your topic. That's because at this stage, things are still rather fluid. You may discover that the object, question, or skill that was going to be your topic is just not tenable at this time. Or you may be researching the historical background for one thing and come across an amazing data set for another thing that changes your direction. Enough pep talk! Give me some real tips: Start at the library. Whether it's your library's website or the physical location, browse the resources that your institution has provided for you. Talk to a librarian you know, they love to help. Start local. Every town has its stories. Archives, museums, historical societies, and special collections can hold original or unique materials about the people and places nearby. In this coursebook, we've worked with data about the inhabitants of the local cemetery and the school newspaper. These local stories may not have been analyzed or shared before, but they still have relevance to larger issues. Not all small institutions have the resources to make their holdings available online, so you may have to talk to someone or get creative. Consider the discipline. Don't forget that scholarly work segments itself by discipline, so you may have to navigate those boundaries. Is your topic fundamentally about literature? About history? About philosophy? What other disciplines does it touch? Check out the scholarly organization for that discipline, its major journals, or research centers. What's my project? # Hopefully, if you've read other sections of this coursebook, you have an idea of what humanities data could look like. But what will your data look like? How do you take a topic idea and turn that into data? During the research process, identify and inventory any existing data sets related to your topic. What's there? What's missing? How might you fill in a gap or take your research in a new direction? Start asking questions. What do you want to know? What can you learn from this object/corpus? You don't have to have a firm research question yet, but you should be wondering things. What kind of approach do you want to take? How might that dictate the form of your data? Do you need a list of people and their attributes for network analysis? Do you want to count things and visualize patterns? Do you need place names and coordinates? Consider your limitations. What is your timeframe? What is your skill level? What data is available already and what must you create yourself? Are you working alone or in a team? Do you have access to everything you need? Are you prepared to do a lot of data entry, or do you know that tedious work is not your thing? Set your scope. Then make your scope a little smaller. Trust me. You can always add more later, but when you're new to this kind of work, it's best to start small. If you want to map something, do you need to map the whole country? WOuld it be better to do a region, a state, or even a county? If you're interested in text mining 19th century literature, perhaps a single genre, author, or timespan could serve as a boundary to that work? At this point, you should be at a place where you can write a proposal for your project. You know the types of things you want to do, the questions you want to explore, even if you don't have the answers yet. If you're still stuck, try this flow chart from The Pudding on Writing a Data-Driven Story Research Questions and Data Modeling # In the data section , we covered the mechanics of data modeling. Here, let's cover it as part of the research and project process. Chances are, data modeling will go hand in hand with determining your specific research questions. You will need to iterate over this process a few times before you've arrived at something feasible. What is one potential research question that you can think of? Pay attention to how you begin your question. Are you asking how many? Who? What? How would you answer that question with some kind of data? It can be an unproven, hypothetical answer, but you should think through what kind of answers you're looking for. Now swim around in your answer a little bit. What is your answer made of? Do you need to count something to get to that answer? What do you need to count? Are you tracking something over time, and therefore need time-based data? Are you looking at relationships, so you need information about people? Make a list of all the pieces of information you might need to answer your question. This could be the beginning of your data model. Go through these steps again with a different question and potential answer. How do your data needs compare? Can you start to see a spreadsheet or a corpus forming? Do you need to do more research? How did that go? Hopefully by working through those questions, you should have an idea of where you're headed. Again, it's totally normal to adjust or go through this cycle again. You may even get to the point of visualization and realize you need to regroup. For now, let's assume you're ready to start putting together your data. You have some options. Creating data # You may determine that you need to create your data set from scratch. What does \"from scratch\" mean? Are eggs involved? Chances are you are not going to be pulling data magically from your brain. It's more likely that you will have a source or multiple sources that need to be transformed in a structured data set that can be analyzed by a piece of software. The draft data model you created will guide you in this process. Many humanities data projects begin with the kind of old books that seem to be forgotten about on library shelves. Scholars of past centuries did a lot of data-driven work, they just put all their data into a print book, and now that information needs to be transformed. For example, The Ancient Graffiti Project relies on a 19th century collection of inscriptions gathered into set of large, heavy volumes known as Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum . Mapping the Scottish Reformation is a prosopography project that gathers data about Scottish ministers from a text known as the Fasti . While the author of the Fasti , Hew Scott, did tremendous work in compiling this text, he was loose with the facts and didn't cite his sources. In the end, both of these projects will provide a database and visualizations for users to ask their own research questions. But the process of getting there involves careful data entry and cross-referencing. The project team is not necessarily transcribing texts from beginning to end, they are extracting each data point in a way that fits their data model. They might not extract every piece of information, instead, they're letting their project goals guide them. Rest assured, both of these projects added to and refined their data model over time. If you have generated some research questions and drafted a data model, go ahead and open up a new spreadsheet. Label some fields, start filling in data, then step back and review your work. Does your source include information you forgot to put in your data model? Do these fields make sense to another person? Do you need another spreadsheet? On the flip side, are you trying to gather too much data? Do you need every single detail? If you're not sure how to answer these questions, why not skip ahead to visualization or analysis? Test out the data you've gathered so far, even if it's not complete, just to see how it performs. Again, this iterative approach is key to creating a workable project. Finding data # You may determine that your project or your constraints require that you find existing data sources. That's great! You're reusing existing information in new ways! But it can be a struggle to find the exact data set you're looking for. There is not one single catalog of data that you can use to find what you're looking for. You may have to combine pieces of multiple data sets. Alternatively, you may not have access or be legally allowed to use the data you're seeking. It's another reason to identify other scholars working on similar topic, you may be able to ask advice or find guidance. Analyzing your data # Okay, let's say you have put together a respectable data set that you think addresses your goals. What next? Throughout this coursebook, we have explored a range of analysis methods. Your research questions should help you determine the method or methods that make sense. But once you start using a method or visualizing your data, how do you know when you're getting answers? Here are some things to keep in mind: Know your material. It's up to you and your understanding of your subject to determine what matters. If you've generated a network graph, but you don't know much about the major players, you're going to struggle. Let your visualizations inspire you to dig back into research topics. Set benchmarks. Running a process once or creating one visualization isn't enough. Perform your analysis methods over and over so you have a sense of what is normal vs. extreme. You might also find errors in your data this way. If you're interested in how often the word \"love\" is used over time, you might want to try synonyms of that word. Do all words behave the same way? What are the trends over time? Is that actually a unique line on your graph? Remember your discipline. Positioning your work within a discipline is not an arbitrary decision. It gives you standards and priorities for your work. A literary scholar is going to approach a text differently than a historian. They're going to care about different questions. If you're a historian, you might be intrigued by the use of literary symbolism in a text, but know that you have to focus on the historical elements, not the style. Read the literature of the discipline and review other projects to get a sense of how their analysis works. Case study: Spanish Gallery # To pull this all together, let's walk through a case study of a project from a former student, Alice. Alice is an art history major with some experience in digital methods from other classes and her work on a DH project. In one of her classes, she learns about the Spanish Gallery . The Spanish Gallery was assembled at the Louvre by King Louis Phillipe in 1838 to showcase Spanish art during a time of French occupation of Spain. After his death, the gallery was sent to auction in London and dispersed into private hands. Alice wonders what happened to these paintings after the auction, as well as their origins in Spain. She imagines what the gallery might have looked like all assembled, similar to a project she put together on Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery . In reading the Wikipedia article, she notices a link to the digital copy of the gallery catalog from 1838. She recognizes these catalog as a potential source of data, especially when combined with her knowledge of searching auction records. The catalog is arranged in alphabetical order by artist, with a brief bio, then a list of the paintings and their dimensions. Alice sees that the digital book is available to download as plain text, which will make it easier to work with. She also notices that the text isn't quite perfect, so she will need to budget time for correction. Not to mention it's all in French! Finally, there appear to be annotations in pencil on the pages, so that may be something to look into. Alice opens Google Sheets and gets to work on this spreadsheet . The catalog has assigned each painting a number, so she uses that as an ID field. The thing that is being described in each row is the painting, with the artist, bio, size, location modifying that painting. After starting that work, she realizes that it's repetitive to include the art information multiple times, so she creates a second sheet that is just a list of the artists and their information. She cleverly uses a built-in translation feature in Google sheets to translate the French to English for the whole column, rather than doing it one by one: =GOOGLETRANSLATE(B2, \"fr\", \"en\") . Alice can't help but start researching the modern locations of these pieces of art. She finds that this work is going to be more challenging than she anticipated, so she creates another sheet to separate this work into a second phase of the project. There just aren't enough accessible records for each piece of work. Phase 1 will have to be about creating data on the gallery itself, Phase 2 will concern the auction and dispersal of the art. Similarly, finding the original locations of the art may be challenging too, since the catalog only lists where the artist was from. She knows another student who has used Google Street View and tourist websites to confirm the location of shrines in Spain. She supposes that's Phase 3! Alice's project is still in progress, but hopefully this example gave you an idea of how a project like this can change as it progresses.

Do you need a list of people and their attributes for network analysis? Do you want to count things and visualize patterns? Do you need place names and coordinates? Consider your limitations. What is your timeframe? What is your skill level? What data is available already and what must you create yourself? Are you working alone or in a team? Do you have access to everything you need? Are you prepared to do a lot of data entry, or do you know that tedious work is not your thing? Set your scope. Then make your scope a little smaller. Trust me. You can always add more later, but when you're new to this kind of work, it's best to start small. If you want to map something, do you need to map the whole country? WOuld it be better to do a region, a state, or even a county? If you're interested in text mining 19th century literature, perhaps a single genre, author, or timespan could serve as a boundary to that work? At this point, you should be at a place where you can write a proposal for your project. You know the types of things you want to do, the questions you want to explore, even if you don't have the answers yet. If you're still stuck, try this flow chart from The Pudding on Writing a Data-Driven Story","title":"What's my project?"},{"location":"process/#research-questions-and-data-modeling","text":"In the data section , we covered the mechanics of data modeling. Here, let's cover it as part of the research and project process. Chances are, data modeling will go hand in hand with determining your specific research questions. You will need to iterate over this process a few times before you've arrived at something feasible. What is one potential research question that you can think of? Pay attention to how you begin your question. Are you asking how many? Who? What? How would you answer that question with some kind of data? It can be an unproven, hypothetical answer, but you should think through what kind of answers you're looking for. Now swim around in your answer a little bit. What is your answer made of? Do you need to count something to get to that answer? What do you need to count? Are you tracking something over time, and therefore need time-based data? Are you looking at relationships, so you need information about people? Make a list of all the pieces of information you might need to answer your question. This could be the beginning of your data model. Go through these steps again with a different question and potential answer. How do your data needs compare? Can you start to see a spreadsheet or a corpus forming? Do you need to do more research? How did that go? Hopefully by working through those questions, you should have an idea of where you're headed. Again, it's totally normal to adjust or go through this cycle again. You may even get to the point of visualization and realize you need to regroup. For now, let's assume you're ready to start putting together your data. You have some options.","title":"Research Questions and Data Modeling"},{"location":"process/#creating-data","text":"You may determine that you need to create your data set from scratch. What does \"from scratch\" mean? Are eggs involved? Chances are you are not going to be pulling data magically from your brain. It's more likely that you will have a source or multiple sources that need to be transformed in a structured data set that can be analyzed by a piece of software. The draft data model you created will guide you in this process. Many humanities data projects begin with the kind of old books that seem to be forgotten about on library shelves. Scholars of past centuries did a lot of data-driven work, they just put all their data into a print book, and now that information needs to be transformed. For example, The Ancient Graffiti Project relies on a 19th century collection of inscriptions gathered into set of large, heavy volumes known as Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum . Mapping the Scottish Reformation is a prosopography project that gathers data about Scottish ministers from a text known as the Fasti . While the author of the Fasti , Hew Scott, did tremendous work in compiling this text, he was loose with the facts and didn't cite his sources. In the end, both of these projects will provide a database and visualizations for users to ask their own research questions. But the process of getting there involves careful data entry and cross-referencing. The project team is not necessarily transcribing texts from beginning to end, they are extracting each data point in a way that fits their data model. They might not extract every piece of information, instead, they're letting their project goals guide them. Rest assured, both of these projects added to and refined their data model over time. If you have generated some research questions and drafted a data model, go ahead and open up a new spreadsheet. Label some fields, start filling in data, then step back and review your work. Does your source include information you forgot to put in your data model? Do these fields make sense to another person? Do you need another spreadsheet? On the flip side, are you trying to gather too much data? Do you need every single detail? If you're not sure how to answer these questions, why not skip ahead to visualization or analysis? Test out the data you've gathered so far, even if it's not complete, just to see how it performs. Again, this iterative approach is key to creating a workable project.","title":"Creating data"},{"location":"process/#finding-data","text":"You may determine that your project or your constraints require that you find existing data sources. That's great! You're reusing existing information in new ways! But it can be a struggle to find the exact data set you're looking for. There is not one single catalog of data that you can use to find what you're looking for. You may have to combine pieces of multiple data sets. Alternatively, you may not have access or be legally allowed to use the data you're seeking. It's another reason to identify other scholars working on similar topic, you may be able to ask advice or find guidance.","title":"Finding data"},{"location":"process/#analyzing-your-data","text":"Okay, let's say you have put together a respectable data set that you think addresses your goals. What next? Throughout this coursebook, we have explored a range of analysis methods. Your research questions should help you determine the method or methods that make sense. But once you start using a method or visualizing your data, how do you know when you're getting answers? Here are some things to keep in mind: Know your material. It's up to you and your understanding of your subject to determine what matters. If you've generated a network graph, but you don't know much about the major players, you're going to struggle. Let your visualizations inspire you to dig back into research topics. Set benchmarks. Running a process once or creating one visualization isn't enough. Perform your analysis methods over and over so you have a sense of what is normal vs. extreme. You might also find errors in your data this way. If you're interested in how often the word \"love\" is used over time, you might want to try synonyms of that word. Do all words behave the same way? What are the trends over time? Is that actually a unique line on your graph? Remember your discipline. Positioning your work within a discipline is not an arbitrary decision. It gives you standards and priorities for your work. A literary scholar is going to approach a text differently than a historian. They're going to care about different questions. If you're a historian, you might be intrigued by the use of literary symbolism in a text, but know that you have to focus on the historical elements, not the style. Read the literature of the discipline and review other projects to get a sense of how their analysis works.","title":"Analyzing your data"},{"location":"process/#case-study-spanish-gallery","text":"To pull this all together, let's walk through a case study of a project from a former student, Alice. Alice is an art history major with some experience in digital methods from other classes and her work on a DH project. In one of her classes, she learns about the Spanish Gallery . The Spanish Gallery was assembled at the Louvre by King Louis Phillipe in 1838 to showcase Spanish art during a time of French occupation of Spain. After his death, the gallery was sent to auction in London and dispersed into private hands. Alice wonders what happened to these paintings after the auction, as well as their origins in Spain. She imagines what the gallery might have looked like all assembled, similar to a project she put together on Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery . In reading the Wikipedia article, she notices a link to the digital copy of the gallery catalog from 1838. She recognizes these catalog as a potential source of data, especially when combined with her knowledge of searching auction records. The catalog is arranged in alphabetical order by artist, with a brief bio, then a list of the paintings and their dimensions. Alice sees that the digital book is available to download as plain text, which will make it easier to work with. She also notices that the text isn't quite perfect, so she will need to budget time for correction. Not to mention it's all in French! Finally, there appear to be annotations in pencil on the pages, so that may be something to look into. Alice opens Google Sheets and gets to work on this spreadsheet . The catalog has assigned each painting a number, so she uses that as an ID field. The thing that is being described in each row is the painting, with the artist, bio, size, location modifying that painting. After starting that work, she realizes that it's repetitive to include the art information multiple times, so she creates a second sheet that is just a list of the artists and their information. She cleverly uses a built-in translation feature in Google sheets to translate the French to English for the whole column, rather than doing it one by one: =GOOGLETRANSLATE(B2, \"fr\", \"en\") . Alice can't help but start researching the modern locations of these pieces of art. She finds that this work is going to be more challenging than she anticipated, so she creates another sheet to separate this work into a second phase of the project. There just aren't enough accessible records for each piece of work. Phase 1 will have to be about creating data on the gallery itself, Phase 2 will concern the auction and dispersal of the art. Similarly, finding the original locations of the art may be challenging too, since the catalog only lists where the artist was from. She knows another student who has used Google Street View and tourist websites to confirm the location of shrines in Spain. She supposes that's Phase 3! Alice's project is still in progress, but hopefully this example gave you an idea of how a project like this can change as it progresses.","title":"Case study: Spanish Gallery"},{"location":"process/#resources","text":"","title":"Resources"},{"location":"protocols/","text":"Course protocols # If you have ever labeled yourself as \u201cbad at technology,\u201d you are welcome in this course.

Since HTML is a document markup language, you'll be marking up your text (or a portion of it) in a similar way. If your text has a heading, you should use the <h1> tag. If your text is a recipe, then a <ol> or <ul> may be appropriate. Your document should also include the tags listed below, so you may need to add a summary to your text or links to other websites. Specs: Due Tuesday by noon. Upload your HTML file(s) to Canvas. Your HTML should be well-formed. Tags should open and close and nest appropriately. Tags should be appropriate to the content they're surrounding. Include the following tags: all the structure tags like <html> <head> <body> <p> one or more level of headings (so <h1> ) one or more links one or more images (use an image on the web, not on your own computer). Include the alt attribute for alternative text. bold or italic text an empty element like a break or horizontal rule a blockquote, a table, and a list (ordered or unordered) one or more <div> tags You can use CSS, but it's not required.

We'll meet in my office/printing studio (Leyburn 218). Don't wear nice clothes, things might get a little messy. Think about a line of text you might want to print on a poster or card. reading/thinking/writing response The impact of printing, especially moveable type, on civilization is immense. Printing made texts more accessible and put information into the hands of more people - think about the changes to religions or science during this period. But we have our own version of this revolution! The internet! In this response, I want you to compare and contrast these major information revolutions. You've been a consumer of the internet and of books, but now you're learning how they're put together. What similarities do you see? Differences? Hone in on one idea or concept from our readings about the history of printing, then find a similar phenomenon today. For example: the \"History of the Book\" text discusses the change to labor practices in printing. I might compare that to the world of content moderation - contract workers who are paid a low wage to review (often horrifying) content to keep out of social media feeds. You might also compare/contrast the act of printing with type to crafting your own HTML document. There's no right answer here - I want to know what you found interesting and the connections that are sparking in your mind. The Whitney Trettien video is another great example of connecting the past to the present, not necessarily seeing them as a simple progression or as concepts that should be view in opposition to each other (print vs. digital). Specs: Due Thursday by noon. 300-400 words Find an idea or concept from our reading (or video) to incorporate into your post. Include a quote and cite your source (doesn't count against your word count). Connect a historical concept to a modern one. Submit on Canvas. read for 9/28 Start reading through Command Line Crash Course . Familiarize yourself with GitHub . Thursday, September 28 # icebreaker what did we think of printing? Command line + GitHub coding activity #3 Your task is to follow the tutorial in the Programming Historian - Bash Command Line tutorial then use git and GitHub to post the results online. First, complete the tutorial. Before you close out, you should save your command line history with the command history > history.txt which will put your commands into a text file. Second, create a new basic website. Just practice, but you should be able to create the basic structure more quickly now. Your website could contain a heading, some text, and a link to a your history.txt file contained in the same folder. Third, use git to create a new repository on your computer containing your website and text file. Set up that repository on GitHub. Push the files to GitHub, then publish with GitHub page. Specs: Due Tuesday by noon. Turn in the link to the GitHub pages site. You must include your command line history in a text file. Your site must be pushed to GitHub using the command line. Your site should be deployed with GitHub Pages. Week 4 - What is a digital edition? # read for 10/3 Digital_Humanities - read page 32-36 Coda Why digital textual scholarship matters - I know this is a lot, but give it a shot. What is Documentary Editing? - Ditto Tuesday, October 3 # icebreaker what are digital editions? slides reading/thinking/writing response Let's spend more time looking at digital editions. For this response, select a project from this list then answer the following questions: Yellow Wallpaper Edition Literature in Context Furnace and Fugue Ticha Questions: Provide a one sentence summary of this project in your own words. What is it about? Who made this project? What kind of roles did the team include? What kind of edition is this? How do they label it? What features does it include (is it annotated? or is there commentary? etc). Where did the text(s) come from? What kind of technology was used in this digital edition? What's neat about this project? What stands out to you about the design or the website features? When, AND ONLY WHEN, you're done with your response, check out the published review of this project on the Reviews in DH site. Include 1-2 sentences on what you got right or what you might have missed. Specs: Due Thursday by noon. 300-500 words. Submit on Canvas. Answer every question above. It can be in bullet list form. If you can't find an answer, say that! Tell me where you looked. Include your response to the published review. read for 10/5 Take a look at Getting Started with Bootstrap for our next step in coding. Make note of words you don't understand. Look them up! Thursday, October 5 # icebreaker Bootstrap coding activity #4 Let's practice with Bootstrap some more. Build on the new site you created in class. The topic can be of your choosing! But you need to incorporate the following: Grid system - Some of your content should be in multiple columns. Table - Jazz up a table with some \"accented features.\" Include a navbar. The links don't have to go anywhere. Components - Add three different components from this section of the docs (besides navbar). Specs: Due Tuesday 10/10 at noon. Create a new Git repo on your computer and on Github.com. Push your code to that repo. Publish your site via GitHub pages. Turn in the GitHub pages link on Canvas. While you can add your own CSS in a style.css file, try to incorporate Bootstrap's built-in styling options through the use of class names. While we're taking a grab bag approach, your page should still make sense and your code should be well-formed. Week 5 - RHS + break! # read for 10/10 Let's prep for our guest speaker: Eric Wilson, the Director of the Rockbridge Historical Society. Spend some time on the RHS website . What are the most recent programs? Who and what do they concern? What are the major activities of this organization? Watch this History of Rockbridge County video. Take a little walk (or drive if you have a car) through campus, Lexington, or the county. What do you observe? What evidence of the past remains? What do you wonder about? Remember, we're going to be working with the RHS Proceedings . Start looking through these volumes and getting a sense of topics. We also have an index available that lists all the individual articles. You'll need to settle on a topic for the proposal on 10/19 so it's time to get thinking. Finally, think of some questions for Eric. Your questions could be about the local community, its history, or the work of the organization.

For this response, think about a text that you have spent time with before. It could be a novel you studied in high school, a picture book you read over and over, a poem you had to memorize, a pamphlet that lives in a drawer, a letter from a friend or family member, or even the instructions to your favorite game. It really could be anything, there's no right answer here, but we will continue to engage with this text and you will be asked to share, so keep that in mind in making your selection. Describe it. What is this text? What container is it in? Is that container unique or one of many copies? Who wrote it? Is there a single, identified author or not? Is it published? How can you access the text? Can you buy it or check it out of the library? Print or digital or both? How did this text come to be? What other forms might exist? In 50 years, will someone be able to read this text? How? Could it be studied by a scholar? Which of our definitions of text seems to apply here? Include a picture if you have. Specs: Due Thursday by noon. 300-400 words Submit on Canvas. Free from grammatical errors, typos. Your post should address the prompt thoroughly. Responses that only engage with a portion of the questions may not pass. Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links.

HTML + CSS coding activity #1 Let's keep practicing your HTML. For the next few weeks, we're going to build a small website about the text you wrote about for Tuesday. Since HTML is a document markup language, you'll be marking up your text (or a portion of it) in a similar way. If your text has a heading, you should use the <h1> tag. If your text is a recipe, then a <ol> or <ul> may be appropriate. Your document should also include the tags listed below, so you may need to add a summary to your text or links to other websites. Specs: Due Tuesday by noon. Upload your HTML file(s) to Canvas. Your HTML should be well-formed. Tags should open and close and nest appropriately. Tags should be appropriate to the content they're surrounding. Include the following tags: all the structure tags like <html> <head> <body> <p> one or more level of headings (so <h1> ) one or more links one or more images (use an image on the web, not on your own computer).

We'll meet in my office/printing studio (Leyburn 218). Don't wear nice clothes, things might get a little messy. Think about a line of text you might want to print on a poster or card. reading/thinking/writing response The impact of printing, especially moveable type, on civilization is immense. Printing made texts more accessible and put information into the hands of more people - think about the changes to religions or science during this period. But we have our own version of this revolution! The internet! In this response, I want you to compare and contrast these major information revolutions. You've been a consumer of the internet and of books, but now you're learning how they're put together. What similarities do you see? Differences? Hone in on one idea or concept from our readings about the history of printing, then find a similar phenomenon today. For example: the \"History of the Book\" text discusses the change to labor practices in printing. I might compare that to the world of content moderation - contract workers who are paid a low wage to review (often horrifying) content to keep out of social media feeds. You might also compare/contrast the act of printing with type to crafting your own HTML document. There's no right answer here - I want to know what you found interesting and the connections that are sparking in your mind. The Whitney Trettien video is another great example of connecting the past to the present, not necessarily seeing them as a simple progression or as concepts that should be view in opposition to each other (print vs. digital). Specs: Due Thursday by noon. 300-400 words Find an idea or concept from our reading (or video) to incorporate into your post. Include a quote and cite your source (doesn't count against your word count). Connect a historical concept to a modern one.

First, complete the tutorial. Before you close out, you should save your command line history with the command history > history.txt which will put your commands into a text file. Second, create a new basic website. Just practice, but you should be able to create the basic structure more quickly now. Your website could contain a heading, some text, and a link to a your history.txt file contained in the same folder. Third, use git to create a new repository on your computer containing your website and text file. Set up that repository on GitHub. Push the files to GitHub, then publish with GitHub page.
